Something about distribution of goals vs league or qualifying games.
This could be the minute they are scored in or just the number of goals.
Use 1996-2012 only as all had 16 teams

Requirements
DONE all results from 1996-2012 (31*5=155 matches)
DONE E0,SP1,D1,F1,I1 league results from 96,00,04,08,12 (have most already)
DONE goal times for all euro matches? On wikipedia pages.

Plots
DONE av goals per game for each year, along with values from major leagues in
  the preceding season, maybe as grouped points with std dev error bars
  *Dimple bars vertical grouped*
  - this shows Euros below all leagues in 96,04,12, joint last with France
      in 08, middle in 00. Germany most goals all years, France
      least 4/5 times.
  - means are 2.51 group stages, 1.94 knockouts
DONE overlaid freqpolys for goal time distribution? *Dimple steps horiz stacked*
    or *vert stacked group bar* to include injury time part
  - More goals in second half; particularly few in first 15 mines in KOs.
  - leagues all show ~44% goals first half. Groups 39%, knockouts 38%.

Can't find game stats for older champs.
