Something about distribution of goals vs league or qualifying games.
This could be the minute they are scored in or just the number of goals.
Use 1996-2012 only as all had 16 teams

Requirements
DONE all results from 1996-2012 (31*5=155 matches)
DONE E0,SP1,D1,F1,I1 league results from 96,00,04,08,12 (have most already)
DONE goal times for all euro matches? On wikipedia pages.

Plots
- scatter of goals per game against game number in each champ, coloured by
  year, with running average lines, overlaying the 5 champs
  - means are 2.51 group stages, 1.94 knockouts
- av goals per game for each year, along with values from major leagues in
  the preceding season, maybe as grouped points with std dev error bars
  *Dimple bars vertical grouped*
  - this shows Euros below all leagues in 96,04,12, joint last with France
      in 08, middle in 00. Germany most goals all years, France
      least 4/5 times.
- overlaid freqpolys for goal time distribution? *Dimple steps horiz stacked*
  - More goals in second half; particularly few in first 15 mines in KOs.

Can't find game stats for older champs.
